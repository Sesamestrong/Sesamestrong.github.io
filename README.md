# Blocky Jump

A revolution in 3D gaming is here, in your very own browser!

Just follow the link: [Blocky Jump](https://www.blockyjump.me)

You can make your own levels, play user-generated levels on the level list, and even play computer-created levels built just for you!

To beat a level, either reach the top of the level or touch the green block. Lava kills you, you can jump on platforms, and swim in water. Good luck!

Try out a high-quality, special and fun level, go to [this link](https://www.blockyjump.me/levels/Leaky_Sewer)!

Have a nice day!
